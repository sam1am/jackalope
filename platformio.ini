; --- SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED HERE ---

; 1. Add library dependency for the OLED display. The ESP32 core provides BLE.
lib_deps =
    thingpulse/ESP8266 and ESP32 OLED driver for SSD1306 displays

; 2. Enable PSRAM, tell the camera library which board we are using, and define the BLE device name.
build_flags =
    -D BOARD_HAS_PSRAM
    -D CAMERA_MODEL_TTGO_T_CAMERA_V162
    -D BLE_DEVICE_NAME="\"T-Camera-BLE\""

; 3. Ensure we have enough space for the large camera application firmware.
